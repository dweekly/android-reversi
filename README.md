===============

A port of my Reversi / Othello game to the Android platform. (not yet fun!)

July 13, 2013: First actually-playable version!
* Fixed view layout & background issues
* Added 300ms pause before computer turn
* Correctly handle end-game

July 23, 2013:
* Fixed issue with the AI moving first on the second game.

July 25, 2013:
* Actually displays end-of-game alert now.
* Game is fun to play!
* Reduced lookahead to 3 from 5 for playability on older devices

IMMEDIATE TODOs:
* Add Game Over screen that displays score before starting a new game
* Add 'Resign' button
* Import audio effects from iOS client
* Import icons/graphics from iOS client
* Allow user to select difficulty level

BIGGER TODOs:
* Include other A.I.s?
* Add two-player local-human gameplay
* Facebook login, Parse backend for challenging friends
* Send moves to server to validate fair matches & keep rankings
